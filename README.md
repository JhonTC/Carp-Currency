**A Minecraft mod to add managed currency.**
### Why?
The purpose of the mod is to add an item which can be as the purchase cost for the tablecloth shops in the Create mod.
We wanted to have a single currency which couldn't be mined or made in a crafting bench.

### Hows' it work?
Notes are a currency that can be only printed by a minter in exchange for diamonds. They can be crafted into higher derivatives and back.
The Minter currently has no build recipe so must be spawned in by the player or server moderator.

### Items & Blocks
The following items and blocks are included...
- **Note**
- **Strap of Notes**
- **Block of Notes**
- **Mechanical Minter** (not craftable at this time)
